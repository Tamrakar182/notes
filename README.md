# Notes for CSIT

This is a notes website I made for my third semester of BSc. CSIT. It is based on [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for writing notes. I use Obsidian to write notes and publish them to this website. Check it out [here](https://tamrakar182.github.io/notes/).

Check out some of the [amazing gardens that community members](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/showcase/) have published with Quartz! You can get started with Quartz by [forking this repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)
