# Notes for CSIT

This is a notes website I made for my third semester of BSc. CSIT. It is based on [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for writing notes. I use Obsidian to write notes and publish them to this website.

Check out some of the [amazing gardens that community members](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/showcase/) have published with Quartz!
