# Circular Queue

Circular Queue is a temporary storage device which stores data and performs [[Inqueue]] and [[Dequeue]] operations in a [[FIFO]] sequence. Sequence CQ connects REAR and FRONT of [[linear queue]] in a circular manner of operations.

#### Example:

##### Linear Queue
| A   | B   | C   | D   | E   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |

##### Circular Queue
``Reminder: put a circular queue figure``

#### Trace process or algorithm for Circular Queue for `inqueue` and `dequeue` of items `{A, B, C}`
- `Maxsize of CQ = 3 (0 to 2)`
- Rear, front
