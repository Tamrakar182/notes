# Linear Data Structure

A linear Data Structure is any organization of data where the elements are orders in a sequence and are not in any hierarchy. The implementation process of Linear Data Structures is relatively easy and elements can be traversed in a single run. However, linear data structures aren't as memory efficient. Example: [[stack]], [[queue]], [[array]], etc.
