# Non-Linear Data Structure

A non-linear Data Structure is any organization of data where the elements are orders in a hierarchical order. The implementation process of Non-Linear Data Structures is relatively complex and it takes multiple runs to traverse the data. However, non-linear data structures are quite memory efficient. Example: [[Third Semester/Data Structures and Algorithms/Tree|Tree]], [[graph]], [[hash table]], etc.
