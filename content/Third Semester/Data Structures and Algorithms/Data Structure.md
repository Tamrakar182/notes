# Data Structure

A Data Structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. It is a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed and used efficiently.

The following are some of the reasons why data structures are important:
1. Efficient Data Access and Manipulation
2. Algorithm Design
3. Performance Optimization
4. Problem Solving

### Types of Data Structures:
